# Heart_Disease_Prediction
This project combines machine learning and natural language processing to predict heart disease and summarize medical text. 
It features a user-friendly interface built with Tkinter, where users can input health data such as age, cholesterol, and blood pressure to predict heart disease using algorithms like SVM, Random Forest, and KNN. 
The system selects the best-performing model based on the dataset and provides predictions within the app.

Additionally, the application includes a text summarization feature that uses a BERT-based model to generate concise summaries of input medical text. This dual functionality makes the project useful for both health prediction and text analysis in the medical domain.
